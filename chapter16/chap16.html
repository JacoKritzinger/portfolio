        <p>You are the captain of a spaceship named "The Flying Hippo." One day, you're working on tuning up your ship's engines when you get an urgent message on your space phone:</p>
        <p>"Captain, one of our Mars robots is sick. We need you to go to Mars immediately and retrieve it so that we can fix it and download the results of its important experiments."</p>
        <p>You remember that you're supposed to go to a meeting of the Space Scouts tonight, and you were really looking forward to it. But, on the other hand, the other Space Scouts would understand that this mission is very important.</p>
        <p>What do you do? Go to Mars, or stay home?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="storyPart" id="answer02">
        <p>Answer Yes when you're ready!</p>

        <p>Great choice! Mars is lovely this time of year (or, during the time of the year when you'll arrive, about 260 days from now!).</p>
        <p>You pack up your things and prepare enough food for the journey, then take off!</p>
        <p>Launch goes smoothly and you sit back, put on your headphones, and prepare for a relaxing trip.</p>
        <p>A week later, things are going great. There's nothing for you to do except read, listen to music, and watch movies. Just then, you hear a strange sound.</p>
        <p>"meow."</p>
        <p>It sounds like Gizmo, your cat! She must have snuck aboard while you were packing!</p>
        <p>You're happy to have the company, but you didn't pack enough food for the both of you, and there certainly isn't a grocery store on the way to Mars.</p>
        <p>You have a choice: risk running out of food on the return trip, or turn around now and go home. What will you do?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="storyPart" id="answer12">
        <p>You decide to stay home. They'll get someone else to fly to Mars. Besides, you heard that they're going to have free pizza at the Space Scouts meeting!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="storyPart" id="err1">
        <p>Please answer Mars or Earth.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="storyPart" id="answer21">
        <p>You decide to risk it. The journey is long, and you give sweet Gizmo half your food, knowing that you may not survive the return trip, but the Flying Hippo can carry the robot home without you, and at least the important experimental data (and
            Gizmo, of course) will be safe.</p>
        <p>When you arrive at Mars, you quickly locate the sick robot. But, you also discover something else:a bean bag full of glowing beans that have never been seen before</p>
        <p>you se that there is not enough space for both the robot and the beans bag so you have to chose.</p>
        <p>do you chose: the bean bag or the robot.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="storyPart" id="answer22">
        <p>Let someone else get the robot. You turn the Flying Hippo around and head home.</p>
        <p>When you get back to the spaceport, you open the door to exit your spaceship and your boss is standing outside.</p>
        <p>You apologize and explain the whole thing to him about how there wouldn't have been enough food.</p>
        <p>He says he'll send someone else if you dont want to leave Gizmo or you can leave Gizmo safe with him and return back on your journey to Mars </p>
        <p>Do you leave Gizmo or stay home.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="storyPart" id="err2">
        <p>Please answer Risk It or Go Home.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="storyPart" id="answer31">
        <p>You chose to take the bean bag.</p>
        <p>on your way back you see there is a spaceship following you in you spaceships rear mirror</p>
        <p>you see they are gaining on your spaceship and with zero to non time left you deside there is only so much you can do.</p>
        <p>you have two options and time is running out,do you hide the beans or do you eat the beans</p>
    </div>
    <div class="storyPart" id="answer32">
        <p>you chose the robot.</p>
        <p>on your way back to Earth you see the robot is having a chat with lola the security AI and one thing led to another.</p>
        <p>the robot told lola he wants to drive the spaceship with knowing he do not have any expirience .</p>
        <p>next moment he flow into the sun and everyone on the ship is gone.</p>
